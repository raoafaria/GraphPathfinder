# GraphPathfinder

A Python-based interactive tool that implements and visualizes three fundamental shortest path algorithms:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

This hands-on assignment allows you to test these algorithms on a sample graph directly through a menu-driven CLI.
